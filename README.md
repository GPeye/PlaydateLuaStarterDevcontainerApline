# PlaydateLuaStarterDevcontainerApline
A hello world starter project for Lua Playdate games that uses an alpine devcontainer for the dev environment

This assumes you already have the sdk installed and have it located at /etc/PlaydateSDK and docker installed. It relies on vs code devcontainers

This is pretty much just for me so I have a repeatable containerized dev environment that will get me off the ground quickly for new projects regardless of what pc I'm on and not having to worry about build tools.

I'm sure if I was smart enough I could get the simulator to run inside the container too and have it route to the host but for now you need the simulator installed locally to test your pdx's
